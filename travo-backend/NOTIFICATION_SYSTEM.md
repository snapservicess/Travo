## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`:

```env
# Email Configuration (Gmail)
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password

# SMS Configuration (Twilio)
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your-twilio-sid
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your-twilio-token
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=+1234567890

# Demo Mode (for development)
DEMO_MODE=true
```

### Email Setup (Gmail)
1. Enable 2-Factor Authentication on your Gmail account
2. Generate an App Password at https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
3. Use the App Password in EMAIL_PASS (not your regular password)

### SMS Setup (Twilio)
1. Create a Twilio account at https://www.twilio.com/
2. Get your Account SID and Auth Token from the Console
3. Purchase a phone number for sending SMS

### Demo Mode
Set `DEMO_MODE=true` to log notifications to console without sending real emails/SMS. Perfect for development and testing.

## Integration with Models

### Emergency Model Integration
The notification service is automatically triggered when:
- New emergency is created (sends emergency alert)
- Emergency status changes to 'resolved' (sends confirmation)

### Tourist Tracking Integration
Notifications are location-aware and can target:
- Tourists in specific cities/areas
- Active vs inactive tourists
- Users with emergency status

## Error Handling

### Notification Failures
- Failed notifications are logged with error details
- Bulk notifications continue even if individual sends fail
- Results include success/failure counts and details

### Rate Limiting
- Email: No specific limits (uses Gmail quotas)
- SMS: Twilio rate limits apply (check your account)
- API endpoints: Rate limited to prevent abuse

## Monitoring & Logging

### Console Logging
```
üì± SMS sent: SM1234567890abcdef
üìß Email sent: <message-id@gmail.com>
üîî Push Notification (Demo): Title - Body
üì¢ Emergency notification sent for SOS-12345: {sent: 2, failed: 0}
```

### Response Format
All notification endpoints return standardized responses:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Notifications sent successfully",
  "result": {
    "type": "emergency",
    "totalUsers": 5,
    "successful": 4,
    "failed": 1,
    "details": [...]
  }
}
```

## Usage Examples

### 1. Automatic Emergency Notifications
When a tourist presses the SOS button, notifications are automatically sent via the Emergency model's post-save middleware.

### 2. Weather Alert for Specific Area
Tourism officers can send weather alerts to all active tourists in a specific location.

### 3. Safety Score Updates
When safety conditions change, officers can notify tourists about updated safety scores and recommendations.

### 4. Bulk Messaging
Send important updates to multiple tourists simultaneously with detailed success/failure reporting.

## Development & Testing

### Running in Demo Mode
Set `DEMO_MODE=true` to test notifications without sending real messages:
- Email notifications logged to console
- SMS notifications logged to console  
- Push notifications logged to console

### Testing Real Notifications
1. Configure email and SMS credentials
2. Set `DEMO_MODE=false`
3. Use the test endpoint to verify configuration

### Adding New Notification Types
1. Add template to `notificationService.js` templates object
2. Add validation to `/api/notifications/send` endpoint
3. Create specific endpoint if needed (like weather-alert)

## Security Considerations

### Authentication
- All notification endpoints require officer or admin authentication
- JWT tokens validated for each request

### Rate Limiting
- Prevents notification spam
- Configurable limits per environment

### Data Validation
- All input validated before processing
- Sanitized data in notification templates

### Privacy
- User contact information encrypted in transit
- Notification logs do not store sensitive data

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- Real-time push notifications via Firebase/FCM
- WebSocket integration for dashboard alerts
- Email delivery tracking and read receipts
- SMS delivery status webhooks
- Notification preferences per user
- Template customization interface
- Analytics and reporting dashboard

### Integration Points
- Mobile app push notification registration
- WebSocket server for real-time updates
- External API integrations (weather services)
- Advanced targeting based on user preferences

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Gmail Authentication Error**
   - Ensure 2FA is enabled
   - Use App Password, not regular password
   - Check EMAIL_USER format

2. **Twilio SMS Failures**
   - Verify phone number format (+1234567890)
   - Check account balance
   - Confirm phone number is verified

3. **Rate Limit Errors**
   - Reduce bulk notification batch size
   - Implement delay between batches
   - Check service provider limits

4. **Template Rendering Issues**
   - Validate data object structure
   - Check for missing required fields
   - Review template syntax

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging by setting `NODE_ENV=development` to see detailed notification processing logs.
